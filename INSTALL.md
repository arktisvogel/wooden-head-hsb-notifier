Installing `wooden-head-hsb-notifier`
=====================================

The `wooden-head-hsb-notifier` application is in a single shell-script. There is a dependency: you must have `jshon` installed on your system. You are expected to have the following two tools on your system: “`tr`” and “`grep`”.
